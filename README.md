# Samm YT
Smaller projects that don't need their own repositories specificately shown on YouTube

# Build Requirements
- MAKE
- GCC (I'm using Mingw64)

# Building
1. Find the folder name of the project you want to compile within the projects folder
2. Compile that project using the command ```make PROJECT=[project you want to compile] OS=[WIN, LINUX, or MACOS (although i've only tested WIN)] [optional: ARCH=[currently just x86 or x64] STATE=[RELEASE or DEBUG] TYPE=[just SOFTWARE for now]] one```

# Build Example
```make PROJECT=float_compress OS=WIN one```

# Note
none of these projects are done in fact I've been having trouble getting the makefile to work so this is a work in progress
